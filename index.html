    <h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
    <p>I'm a passionate learner on a journey into the exciting world of web development.</p>
        <p>üöö I initially kickstarted my career as a Logistician, navigating the logistics world for a year.
        However, a friend's challenge to create a website for his small business changed the course of my career.

        into the realm of web development.</p>
